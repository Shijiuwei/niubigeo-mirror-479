Remeasurement incurs costs and requires an isolated product service, a frozen plan and explicit live authorization. Reading and exporting do not call models.

## Limits and disclosure

This is a public-product observation. Inclusion does not imply a partnership or endorsement.

Model descriptions are not verified market facts. A returned source does not establish that its content is correct or caused a recommendation. Unknown, missing, analysis failure and request failure remain separate. Use the evidence to investigate descriptions or sources, not to assert optimization caused a difference.
